<Steps>

### Create a new project and initialize your package manager

```bash
npm init -y
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install motion
```

### Install Vite

Vite is required to bundle npm dependencies so they work in the browser:

```bash
npm install -D vite
```

### Update package.json

Add scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

Now you can run the following commands:

- `npm run dev` to start the development server
- `npm run build` to build the project
- `npm run preview` to preview the built project

### Project Structure

Your project should look like this:

```txt
project-root/
├─ index.html
├─ script.js
├─ style.css
├─ package.json
```

Vite uses `index.html` as the entry point and rewrites npm imports automatically.

### Add components

You can now start adding Atlas UI components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://atlasui.vercel.app/r/reveal-effect-js.json
```

The above command will add `RevealEffect` component to your project in the `reveal-effect` directory with its own `index.html`, `index.js`, and `style.css` files.

```txt
project-root/
├─reveal-effect/
│  ├─index.html
│  ├─script.js
│  └─style.css
├─ index.html
├─ script.js
├─ style.css
├─ package.json
```

**Note:** We are adding the `html` and `css` files to make sure the component works without additional setup. You can then copy and paste the javascript logic from the `script.js` file to integrate it into your main project so you can style and customize it as needed.

Visit http://localhost:5173/reveal-effect/index.html to see the component in action.
