Atlas UI is an open-source library of animated components powered by Motion (previously Framer Motion). It’s designed to help developers build beautiful, fluid and sleek UIs with ease — whether you're using React, Next.js, or Vanilla JavaScript.

Atlas UI is inspired by libraries like shadcn/ui and Aceternity UI, blending clean, minimal design with expressive motion.

All React and Next.js components are built using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a modern development experience with full customizability.

## Features

- **Motion-first animations:**
Atlas UI components are powered by Motion, providing smooth and fluid animations that enhance user experience.

- **Framework-ready:**
Atlas UI is designed to work seamlessly with React, Next.js, and Vanilla JavaScript, making it easy to integrate into your existing projects.

- **Copy-paste friendly:**
All components are designed to be easily copy-pasted into your projects. You can simply import the components you need and start using them right away.

- **Open source:**
Fully open-source, allowing you to customize and extend the components to fit your needs.

## Composition

Atlas UI components are thoughtfully structured for flexibility, customization, and ease of use — no matter your tech stack.

### React/Next.js

- Built with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Styled using Tailwind CSS for utility-first design and full customizability
- Powered by Motion for animations and transitions

These components are ideal for React or Next.js projects that want clean structure, expressive motion, and rapid development with Tailwind.

### Vanilla JavaScript

- Built using plain JavaScript
- Animations and Transistions powered by Motion
- Styled using vanilla CSS

These components are perfect for landing pages, marketing sites, or non-React apps where you want beautiful, animated UI without the overhead of a framework.
