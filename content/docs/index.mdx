AtlasUI is an open-source library offering a suite of prebuilt animated components for React, Next.js, and Vanilla JS. Designed for developers, it simplifies UI development by providing sleek, ready-to-use components powered by motion (previously Framer Motion) and styled with Tailwind CSS.

Whether you need interactive buttons, modals, cursor effects, or full-blown UI elements, AtlasUI allows you to copy, paste, and integrate them seamlessly into your projects.

## Why AtlasUI?

**Plug-and-Play Simplicity:**

**Inspired by shadcn/ui:**
